## Notes:
Refactoring Obie to use Redux

## What is Obie?
Obie is an all in one roommate and landlord management application.
- **Communication** - Utilizes sockets to allow for real time communication within a household or with a landlord.
- **Finances** - Tenants easily manage, split and pay their bills and household expenses and landlords receive rent payments and maintain a log of activity.
- **Accountability** - Roommates are held accountable for managing their responsibilities or chores as well as paying each other on time.
- **Management** - Landlords can easily manage multiple properties while maintaining a simple interface to juggle each property's finances separately or all at once.
